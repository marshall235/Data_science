Introduction
In this project, we conducted an interactive storytelling experiment to understand how different gameplay conditions influence various aspects of storytelling, including co-creativity, believability, and artefact quality. The experiment involved participants engaging with different interactive storytelling scenarios under baseline and high-level gameplay conditions.

Getting Started
To run the analysis code and replicate the results, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed (Pandas, SciPy, etc.).
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run the analysis scripts to perform statistical tests and generate results.
Analysis Overview
The analysis is divided into three main parts:

Co-Creativity Analysis: We investigate how the level of gameplay impacts co-creativity between participants and the virtual character. We perform Mann-Whitney U tests to compare baseline and high-level conditions.

Believability Analysis: We explore the effect of gameplay conditions on the perceived believability of the story characters. Mann-Whitney U tests are conducted to compare baseline and high-level conditions.

Artefact Quality Analysis: The analysis focuses on the quality of the storytelling artefacts created by participants. We use both Mann-Whitney U tests and Wilcoxon signed rank tests to assess the differences between baseline and high-level conditions.

Results
The results of the analysis reveal interesting insights into the impact of gameplay conditions on co-creativity, believability, and artefact quality. The p-values and correlation coefficients provide valuable information about the relationships between different variables.

For detailed results, please refer to the analysis output in the Jupyter Notebook files provided in the repository.
