Introduction
Welcome to the K-Means Clustering README! This document provides an overview of K-Means Clustering, a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning data points into clusters. Whether you're new to machine learning or an experienced practitioner, this README aims to help you understand, implement, and utilize K-Means clustering effectively.

What is K-Means Clustering?
K-Means Clustering is a simple yet powerful algorithm used in machine learning and data analysis to classify and group data points into clusters based on their similarities. The main objective of K-Means is to minimize the intra-cluster variance, making data points within the same cluster as similar as possible, while keeping clusters distinct from each other.

How K-Means Works
The K-Means algorithm operates in the following steps:

Initialization: Choose the number of clusters (k) and randomly initialize k cluster centroids.

Assignment: Assign each data point to the nearest cluster centroid based on a chosen distance metric, commonly Euclidean distance.

Update Centroids: Calculate the new centroids of each cluster by taking the mean of all data points assigned to that cluster.

Repeat: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated iteratively until convergence, i.e., when the centroids no longer change significantly or a predefined number of iterations is reached.

Final Clusters: Once convergence is achieved, the algorithm provides the final clusters of data points.

Getting Started
Installation
To use the K-Means Clustering algorithm, you can follow these steps:

Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/k-means-clustering.git
Change directory:

bash
cd k-means-clustering
Install dependencies (if any):

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
If you are using R, you can follow the steps outlined below to perform K-Means Clustering:

r
# Step 1: Import the data from CSV
data <- read.csv("C:/Users/fredy/Downloads/Employees.csv")

# Step 2: Select the variables for analysis
variables <- data[, c("Age", "MonthlyIncome", "PercentSalaryHike", "YearsAtCompany")]

# Step 3: Scale the data and set the random seed
set.seed(42)
scaled_data <- scale(variables)

# Step 4: Create a function to calculate the total within-cluster sum of squared deviations
total_within_ss <- function(k) {
  kmeans_results <- kmeans(scaled_data, centers = k, nstart = 10)
  return(kmeans_results$tot.withinss)
}

# ... (continue with the remaining steps)
Refer to the complete R script for detailed instructions on using K-Means Clustering with your data.
