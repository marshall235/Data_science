Background
Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine whether there is enough evidence in a sample of data to infer a certain hypothesis about the population. In this repository, we perform two separate hypothesis tests to draw conclusions based on the provided data.

Question 1: Effect of Speed and Agility Camp on Football Players' Dash Speed
In this analysis, we investigate whether a speed and agility camp had a significant impact on the 30-yard dash speed of football players. The null and alternative hypotheses are as follows:

H₀: The mean 30-yard dash speed of the players before the camp is equal to the mean 30-yard dash speed of the players after the camp.
H₁: The mean 30-yard dash speed of the players before the camp is less than the mean 30-yard dash speed of the players after the camp.
We conducted a one-tailed paired sample t-test to analyze the data. The results indicate that the test statistic falls within the non-rejection region, and the p-value is not statistically significant at the 5% significance level. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the speed and agility camp significantly improved the players' dash speed.

Question 2: LSAT Scores of Harvard Law School Freshmen
In this analysis, we explore whether Harvard law school freshmen have a mean LSAT score significantly higher than the claimed mean LSAT score of 463. The null and alternative hypotheses are as follows:

H₀: The mean LSAT score of Harvard law school freshmen is equal to the claimed mean LSAT score of 463.
H₁: The mean LSAT score of Harvard law school freshmen is not equal to the claimed mean LSAT score of 463.
We performed a two-sample hypothesis test to analyze the data. The results indicate that the test statistic falls in the rejection region, and the p-value is highly significant at the 5% significance level. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is strong evidence to suggest that Harvard law school freshmen have a mean LSAT score significantly higher than the claimed mean score of 463.

Conclusion
This README provides an overview of the hypothesis tests conducted on the provided data. The analyses and interpretations of the results for both questions are detailed above, highlighting the hypotheses, testing procedures, key statistics, critical values, p-values, and conclusions drawn from the tests.
