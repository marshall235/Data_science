Introduction
Welcome to the Regression Analysis README! This document provides an overview of Regression Analysis, a fundamental statistical method used for modeling relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Whether you're new to statistics or an experienced data analyst, this README aims to help you understand, implement, and interpret Regression Analysis effectively.

What is Regression Analysis?
Regression Analysis is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It aims to find the best-fitting linear equation that explains the variation in the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables. Regression Analysis is widely used in various fields, including economics, social sciences, and data science, to make predictions, understand relationships, and infer causal effects.

Getting Started
Installation
To perform Regression Analysis, you can follow these steps:

Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/regression-analysis.git
Change directory:

bash
cd regression-analysis
Install dependencies (if any):

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
If you are using R, you can follow the steps outlined below to perform Regression Analysis:

r
# Read the CSV file
data <- read.csv("C:/Users/fredy/Downloads/Credit.csv")

# Summary statistics
summary(data)

# Count the number of student cardholders
num_students <- sum(data$Student == 1)
num_students

# Set the seed value for reproducibility
set.seed(42)

# ... (continue with the remaining steps)
Refer to the complete R script for detailed instructions on performing Regression Analysis with your data.

Examples
