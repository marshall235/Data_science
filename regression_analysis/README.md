## Introduction

This README serves as a comprehensive guide to Regression Analysis, an essential statistical method for modeling relationships between dependent and independent variables. Whether you're an enthusiast in statistical theory or a data analysis practitioner, this guide equips you to effectively grasp, implement, and interpret Regression Analysis.

## What is Regression Analysis?

Regression Analysis is a powerful statistical technique employed to model the connection between one or more independent variables and a dependent variable. Its primary aim is to identify the optimal linear equation that elucidates the variance in the dependent variable based on the independent variables' values. Applied extensively in fields such as economics, social sciences, and data science, Regression Analysis empowers predictions, relationship comprehension, and causal inference.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To embark on Regression Analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/regression-analysis.git


2. Navigate to the repository:
cd regression-analysis


3. Install necessary dependencies (if any):
pip install -r requirements.txt


### Usage

For R users, follow these steps to conduct Regression Analysis:

```r
# Read the CSV file
data <- read.csv("C:/Users/fredy/Downloads/Credit.csv")

# Obtain summary statistics
summary(data)

# Calculate the count of student cardholders
num_students <- sum(data$Student == 1)
num_students

# Set a seed value for reproducibility
set.seed(42)

# ... (continue with the subsequent steps)
Refer to the complete R script for comprehensive guidance on executing Regression Analysis with your dataset.

Examples
