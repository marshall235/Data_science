# Read the CSV file
data  <- read.csv("C:/Users/fredy/Downloads/Credit.csv")
### Question 1
# Summary statistics
summary(data)
# Count the number of student cardholders
num_students <- sum(data$Student == 1)
num_students

### Question 2
# Set the seed value for reproducibility
set.seed(42)

# Generate random indices for partitioning the data
indices <- sample(1:nrow(data), nrow(data))

# Define the split ratio (50-50)
split_ratio <- 0.5

# Calculate the split point
split_point <- round(split_ratio * nrow(data))

# Create the training and validation datasets
train_data <- data[indices[1:split_point], ]
valid_data <- data[indices[(split_point + 1):nrow(data)], ]
# Select quantitative variables
quant_vars <- train_data[, c("Income", "Limit", "Rating", "Age", "Education", "Balance")]

### Question 3
# Create correlation matrix
cor_matrix <- cor(quant_vars)
cor_matrix

### Question 4
# Perform multiple regression
model <- lm(Balance ~ ., data = train_data)

# Summary of the regression model
summary(model)
# Install and load the 'car' package for VIF calculation
library(car)

### Question 5
# Calculate VIF for predictor variables
vif_values <- vif(model)
vif_values

### Question 6
# Perform multiple regression with selected predictor variables
model_new <- lm(Balance ~ Income + Rating + Age + Education + Student + Gender + Married, data = train_data)

# Summary of the new regression model
summary(model_new)

### Question 7
# Install and load the 'ggplot2' package for plotting
library(ggplot2)

# Create residual plot
residuals <- residuals(model_new)
plot_residuals <- data.frame(Balance = train_data$Balance, Residuals = residuals)

# Create normal probability plot
qqnorm(residuals)
qqline(residuals)



### Question 8
#Examine the regression output from Step (6).
#Quiz question #11: Which predictor variables have statistically significant relationships
#with the outcome variable, Balance? (MC)

### Question 9

# Perform multiple regression with significant predictors
model_final <- lm(Balance ~ Income + Rating + Age + Education + Student, data = train_data)

# Summary of the final regression model
summary(model_final)
#12: What is the slope coefficient for the Age variable?

#13: How would you interpret the slope coefficient for the Rating variable?
interpretation_rating <- "For every one-unit increase in the Rating variable, the predicted credit card balance is expected to increase by 4.750."
interpretation_rating
#14: How would you interpret the slope coefficient for the Student variable?
interpretation_student <- "On average, students have a predicted credit card balance that is 475.6 higher than non-students, holding all other variables constant."
interpretation_student
#15: What is the adjusted R2 for this regression analysis?
adjusted_r2 <- summary(model_final)$adj.r.squared
adjusted_r2
#16: How can this adjusted R2 value be interpreted?
interpretation_adjusted_r2 <- "Approximately 98.3% of the variation in the credit card balance can be explained by the independent variables in the model, after adjusting for the number of variables and sample size."
interpretation_adjusted_r2
#17: What is the standardized slope coefficient for the Income variable?
standardized_slope_income <- coef(model_final)["Income"] / summary(model_final)$coefficients["Income", "Std. Error"]

#18: Looking at the standardized slope coefficients, which variable makes the

##### Question 10
# Perform multiple regression on validation data with significant predictors
model_final_valid <- lm(Balance ~ Income + Rating + Age + Education + Student, data = valid_data)

# Summary of the final regression model on validation data
summary(model_final_valid)

### Question 11
# Read the CSV file for prediction
prediction_data <- read.csv("C:/Users/fredy/Downloads/credit_card_prediction.csv")

# Create a new model with necessary variables
model_prediction <- lm(Balance ~ Income + Rating + Age + Student, data = train_data)


# Predict the balances for new cardholders

# Extract the predicted balances and prediction intervals

# Quiz question #19: What is the predicted balance for new cardholder #1?

#Quiz question #20: What is the 95% prediction interval for the predicted balance for new cardholder #2?
