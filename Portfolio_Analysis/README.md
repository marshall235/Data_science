# Multivariate Linear Regression Analysis

This repository contains R scripts for conducting multivariate linear regression analysis on two different datasets: one for Equal Weighted (EW) portfolios and another for Value Weighted (VW) portfolios. The analysis includes importing data from Excel files, performing regression, displaying summary statistics, and creating visualizations.

## Description

This repository showcases multivariate linear regression analysis using R for two different portfolio types: Equal Weighted (EW) and Value Weighted (VW) portfolios. The analysis includes reading Excel data, conducting regression, displaying summary statistics, and generating visualization plots.

## Folder Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

/Multivariate-Regression-Analysis
├── EW_regression.R
├── VW_regression.R
├── Alpha_Regression_EW.xlsx
├── Alpha_Regression_VW.xlsx
├── README.md
└── Plots
├── EW_regression_plot.png
└── VW_regression_plot.png

bash
Copy code

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Multivariate-Regression-Analysis.git
Open RStudio or your preferred R environment.

Run the scripts:

Run EW_regression.R for Equal Weighted portfolio analysis.
Run VW_regression.R for Value Weighted portfolio analysis.
The scripts will import the relevant Excel datasets, perform multivariate linear regression, display summary statistics, and create plots.

Plots
The /Plots folder contains visualization plots generated by the scripts:

EW_regression_plot.png: Plot showing the results of the Equal Weighted portfolio regression analysis.
VW_regression_plot.png: Plot showing the results of the Value Weighted portfolio regression analysis.
