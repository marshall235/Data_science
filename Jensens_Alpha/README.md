Jensen's Alpha Calculation using Regression Analysis
Jensen's Alpha

Welcome to the Jensen's Alpha Calculation repository! In this project, we explore how to compute Jensen's Alpha using regression analysis in Excel. Jensen's Alpha is a widely used performance measure in the world of finance, helping investors assess whether a portfolio manager has added value beyond the market return. This README will guide you through the process and provide a clear understanding of the steps involved.

Introduction
Jensen's Alpha, also known as the Jensen Index or the Jensen Performance Index, was introduced by Michael C. Jensen in 1968. It assesses the performance of a portfolio manager by comparing the actual portfolio returns to the returns that would be expected based on the portfolio's risk. A positive Jensen's Alpha indicates that the manager has outperformed the market after adjusting for risk, while a negative value suggests underperformance.

Getting Started
To calculate Jensen's Alpha using regression analysis in Excel, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open Excel and load your financial data into a spreadsheet.
Ensure your data includes both the portfolio returns and the market returns for the same time periods.
Data Preparation
Before performing the regression analysis, you need to prepare your data:

Organize your data with the time periods in rows and the portfolio and market returns in columns.
Calculate the excess returns by subtracting the risk-free rate from both the portfolio and market returns.
Regression Analysis
Open Excel and navigate to the Data tab.
Click on "Data Analysis" in the Analysis group.
Select "Regression" and click OK.
In the Regression dialog box, specify the dependent variable (portfolio excess returns) and the independent variable (market excess returns).
Check the "Labels" box if your data includes headers.
Click OK to run the regression analysis.
Note down the regression coefficients, including the intercept and the coefficient for the market excess returns.
Interpreting Results
The intercept of the regression equation represents the portfolio's Jensen's Alpha. If the intercept is positive, it indicates the portfolio has outperformed the market, while a negative intercept suggests underperformance.

Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully calculated Jensen's Alpha using regression analysis in Excel. This powerful performance measure provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of a portfolio manager's decisions. By following the steps outlined in this README, you can confidently assess and compare different investment strategies.
