Introduction
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of warehouse data, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling. The goal of this project is to gain insights into warehouse operations and develop a predictive model for product weight based on various warehouse attributes.

Getting Started
To replicate the analysis and modeling presented in this repository, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required libraries by running: pip install -r requirements.txt.
Download the dataset "Data.xlsx" and place it in the same directory as the Python script.
Data Preprocessing
The dataset is loaded using Pandas, missing values are handled, and categorical variables are converted to appropriate data types. Outliers are explored using box plots, and certain columns are dropped to streamline the analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is performed to understand the distribution of variables and uncover potential relationships. Visualizations include histograms, scatter plots, and bar plots, providing insights into warehouse attributes, location types, and more.

Feature Engineering
New features are created based on existing columns, enhancing the dataset for modeling. These features include the age of the warehouse, total competitors, numeric capacity, warehouse utilization rate, and others.

Predictive Modeling
A linear regression model is developed to predict product weight based on selected attributes. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and missing values are imputed using SimpleImputer. The model's performance is evaluated using the root mean squared error (RMSE).

Data Visualization
Data visualizations are included to visually interpret the relationships between variables and showcase the analysis results. These include scatter plots, histograms, and pair plots.

Conclusion
This repository provides a comprehensive analysis of warehouse data, from preprocessing to predictive modeling. The insights gained from this analysis can assist in optimizing warehouse operations and making informed decisions. Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your own warehouse-related projects.
