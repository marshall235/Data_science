Introduction
Correspondence Analysis is a powerful technique used to analyze the relationships between categorical variables. In this analysis, we explore the chemical composition of different samples using Correspondence Analysis to uncover underlying patterns and associations.

Chemical Variables
The dataset includes the following chemical variables:

N (Nitrogen)
S (Sulfur)
Fe (Iron)
P (Phosphorus)
Ammonia
TC (Total Carbon)
TOC (Total Organic Carbon)
Salinity
Moisture
pH
Contingency Table
We first create a contingency table from the chemical variables data. The table summarizes the relationships between the variables and forms the basis for further analysis.

Chi-Square Test
We perform a chi-square test to evaluate the independence between the chemical variables. The test helps determine whether the observed associations are statistically significant.

Correspondence Analysis
a. Eigenvalues and Variance
We calculate the eigenvalues and variance associated with each dimension in the Correspondence Analysis. These values provide insight into the significance of each dimension in explaining the data's variability.

b. Scree Plot
A scree plot is generated to visualize the eigenvalues and their contribution to the total variance. This plot assists in identifying the most relevant dimensions for analysis.

c. Row Variables Analysis
We analyze the row variables' contributions to the dimensions, including their inertia, quality on the factor map, and contributions. This analysis helps interpret the significance of each variable within the dimensions.

d. Biplot Visualization
A biplot is generated to visualize the relationships between the row and column variables. This graphical representation provides insights into the patterns and associations among the chemical variables.

Summary and Conclusions
The Correspondence Analysis sheds light on the relationships between the chemical variables and their underlying patterns. By analyzing eigenvalues, variance, and contributions, we gain a deeper understanding of the dataset's structure. The biplot visualization further enhances our interpretation of the associations between variables.

This report serves as a comprehensive analysis of the chemical composition dataset using Correspondence Analysis, providing valuable insights into the underlying patterns and relationships.
