Introduction
The primary objective of this project is to perform a series of data analysis and visualization tasks to gain insights and answer questions related to accommodations and reviews. The analysis includes tasks such as data cleaning, visualization of accommodation prices, geographical distribution of accommodations, summarizing accommodations by market/region, sentiment analysis of reviews, and predictive modeling of accommodation prices.

Data Preparation
The analysis begins by loading and preparing the necessary data using the Pandas library. The 'reviews.csv' dataset contains information about reviews, including reviewer details and comments. The 'listings.xlsx' dataset contains information about accommodations, including details about the listing, location, and pricing. Prices are cleaned and missing values are handled to ensure data quality.

Exploratory Data Analysis
Price Distribution of Accommodations: The distribution of accommodation prices is visualized using a boxplot to identify any outliers and understand the spread of prices among accommodations.

Accommodation Distribution on Maps: The geographical distribution of accommodations is plotted on a map using Folium. A marker cluster is used to represent multiple accommodations in the same area.

Accommodation Summaries by Market/Region: The number of accommodations in each market/region is summarized and displayed, providing insights into the availability of accommodations in different areas.

Mean Price of Accommodations by Market/Region: The mean price of accommodations in each market/region is summarized and presented, helping to understand pricing trends across different areas.

Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is performed on the review comments using the NLTK library. The VADER lexicon is used to analyze the sentiment of each comment. Positive, negative, and neutral sentiments are classified based on sentiment scores.

Sentiment Analysis of Reviews: Sentiment analysis is conducted on the review comments to classify them as positive, negative, or neutral based on sentiment scores. The number of positive and negative comments is reported.

Distribution of Sentiment Categories: The distribution of sentiment categories (positive, negative, neutral) is visualized using a pie chart to provide an overview of the sentiment distribution among the reviews.

Predictive Modeling
Predictive modeling is performed to estimate accommodation prices based on various features using the scikit-learn library. A Random Forest Regressor model is trained and evaluated using mean squared error (MSE). Feature importance analysis is conducted to determine the most influential features on price prediction.

Feature Selection and Data Splitting: Relevant features are selected for price prediction, and the data is split into training and testing sets.

Random Forest Regressor Model: A Random Forest Regressor model is trained on the training data to predict accommodation prices.

Evaluation and Feature Importance: The model's performance is evaluated using mean squared error (MSE). Feature importance analysis is conducted to identify the features that contribute the most to price prediction.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data analysis and visualization process, ranging from data preparation and exploratory analysis to sentiment analysis and predictive modeling. The insights gained from these analyses provide valuable information about accommodations, pricing, and customer sentiment, which can aid in decision-making and business strategy.
